# Face Recognition Attendance System

This project implements a Face Recognition Based Attendance Management System using Python and OpenCV. The system captures images, recognizes faces, and records attendance in a user-friendly interface.

**Features**

- Face detection and recognition using OpenCV and face_recognition library.
- Real-time attendance recording.
- Option to add students and capture images for training.
- Blink detection for enhanced security.

**Getting Started**

To run this project on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amit950/face-recognition-attendance.git
   cd face-recognition-attendance
2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Execute the main script:
   python main.py


**Usage**
1.Launch the application.
2.Add students by capturing images or uploading them.
3.Choose the "Go Live" option to start real-time face recognition.
4.Detected faces will be marked in the video feed.
5.Detected students' attendance will be recorded in the "Attendance records" directory.
